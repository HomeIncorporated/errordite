        <p>Helping you make sense of your .net exception logs</p>

            <span class="hero-small">
                Errordite is a <span class="strong-dark">simple plug-in</span> for any .net application that will log details of exceptions generated by your application. 
                Errordite will <span class="strong-dark">group together errors</span> that are the same, either automatically or with rules you define.
                You then decide how to <span class="strong-dark">progress with the errors</span>. 
                You can investigate them, request to ignore them or put them on hold while you have more pressing concerns.
            </span>

            <span class="hero-small">
                Errordite is currently under development but we hope to be launching a <span class="strong-dark">beta in mid 2012</span>. For the duration of the beta access to Errordite will be free.
                Once the beta has closed, there will be an additional <span class="strong-dark">1 month free trial</span> before you will need to begin paying for Errordite.
